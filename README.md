# Smart Refrigerator

## Overview
The **Smart Refrigerator** is an intelligent system designed to enhance food storage efficiency and optimize energy consumption. Implemented virtually using Tinkercad and programmed in C++, the system integrates sensors and actuators for automated monitoring and control.

## Features
- **Door Monitoring:** A flex sensor detects door status and triggers a buzzer if left open for too long.
- **Food Spoilage Detection:** A gas sensor identifies food spoilage odors and alerts the user.
- **Temperature Control:** A temperature sensor ensures optimal cooling conditions.
- **Humidity Regulation:** A potentiometer-based humidity sensor regulates a fan motor to control airflow.
- **Real-Time Data Display:** An I2C LCD provides live sensor readings.
- **Automation:** A micro servo is used for automation.
- **Energy Efficiency & Sustainability:** Aligns with **SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)** by reducing unnecessary energy consumption and **SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production)** by minimizing food waste.

## Components Used
- **Flex Sensor** - Detects door status
- **Gas Sensor** - Detects food spoilage odors
- **Temperature Sensor** - Maintains cooling efficiency
- **Potentiometer (Humidity Sensor)** - Regulates humidity levels
- **Fan Motor** - Adjusts airflow based on humidity levels
- **I2C LCD** - Displays real-time data
- **Micro Servo** - Facilitates automation
- **Buzzer** - Alerts for door status and gas detection
- **Arduino Board** - Microcontroller for processing and control

## Implementation
The project is simulated using **Tinkercad** and programmed in **C++**. Various sensors and actuators are integrated to automate monitoring and control within a refrigerator environment.
